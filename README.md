# GSDC_HackDroid

#Thanks GSDC Students team. I built this project from scratch, in a day itself. I had no prior significant andoird development #experience, so everything was a learning opportunity to me. I fought tooth and nail with time, as gitHub wasn't lettiing me upload my code, nor was commuldle's submit button was working, so I had hack my way and submit the direct links to videos and this project itself.
