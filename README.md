# GSDC_HackDroid

#Thanks GSDC Students team. I built this project from scratch, in a day itself. I had no prior significant andoird development experience, so everything was a learning opportunity to me. I had to hack my way and uplaod these links as commudle wasn't letting me publish my project. 

The project has mainly 2 significant activites, the User end, and the adding new complaint end. The admin end could be easily derived from the userEnd itself, though I fell short of time, hence could'nt implement the same. I ask your pardon.

Thanks agian, for presenting me with the opportunity to work on this project.
